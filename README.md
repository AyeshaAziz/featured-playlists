This technical assessment was an enjoyable experience and presented a few interesting challenges along the way.

# Steps Taken:
## Playlist Service and Models:

Created a playlist service and corresponding models to fetch data from the API. This step was relatively straightforward.
Container Presenter Components:

Developed container and presenter components to display the fetched data.
## Angular Material Components:

One challenge was selecting appropriate Angular Material components, as there was no predefined design to follow. To address this, I took a quick look at the Spotify app for inspiration on how to display the data effectively.
## Ngrx Store and Effects:

Encountered a version compatibility issue while installing the Ngrx store and effects. Initially attempted to install the latest version of Ngrx, but later realized that version 17 isn't compatible with Angular 14. Resolved this by using version 14.3.3.

## Routing for External Playlist:

Implemented routing and gaurds to navigate to external playlists.

## Unit Testing:

Although there is no full test coverage, I made an effort to demonstrate my testing skills by writing unit tests for various components and services.

## Conclusion:

Overall, this assessment provided valuable learning opportunities and allowed me to showcase my skills in Angular development, API integration, UI design, state management with Ngrx, and unit testing. 

I look forward to further feedback and opportunities for improvement

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Install dependencies
 Run `npm install` to install the dependencies in the package.json.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests
